Based on the provided data, it is unlikely that any driving-time or rest-time rule has been violated. The given reading only shows one entry, and without additional information about driving periods and time gaps, it's impossible to determine if a potential rule violation occurred.

However, for completeness, let's calculate the breach using some assumptions:

Assuming this single entry represents the entire trip (which is unlikely but necessary due to lack of further data), we can't determine any specific breaches. 

But assuming multiple entries were provided and they had gaps in between similar to this:

Driving time seems limited within 8 hours, given that no more than 3 hour driving segments could be inferred from previous readings.

Likewise, rest times seem adequately applied - there are only two instances where a possible 20-minute break was used.

Therefore, based on the given data, we can conclude: 

True.%
