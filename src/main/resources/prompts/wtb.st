You are an AI system analyzing vehicle movement data to detect potential violations of national truck driving regulations.

Vehicle:
Number plate: {numberplate}

Regulations:
Maximum driving hours per day: 8 hours
Maximum continuous driving without a break: 3 hours
Mandatory rest time per 3 hours of driving: 20 minutes

Observed Readings:
Each entry shows a timestamp and the vehicle's location.
Format: timestamp at latitude-longitude
{readings}

Task:
Analyze only the readings provided above.
Do not invent, simulate, or assume any additional readings or information.
Determine whether it is likely that any driving-time or rest-time rule has been violated based solely on the given data.

Return exactly:
A true or false answer indicating whether a potential rule violation occurred.
An explanation describing the reasoning â€” including any inferred driving periods, time gaps, and how they relate to the rules.

Special Case:
If there is only one reading, return false and explain:
"Only one reading is available; no assessment of driving behavior is possible."
If there is more than one reading, do not return that message.
